Landscape</h1></header><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="executive-summary">Executive summary<a href="#executive-summary" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Thailand is currently confronted with rapidly worsening and more severe environmental changes—including natural disasters, PM 2.5 air pollution, and pressure from international trade policies in pursuit of transition towards becoming low-carbon economies. At the same time, Thailand’s economic structure continues to rely on coal and oil-generated energy, and employs traditional technologies that are not yet as environmentally friendly as they should ideally be. Therefore, in order for the Thai economy to transition towards becoming more environmentally-friendly, and to reach the goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 and net-zero emissions by 2065 as pledged by the government, there needs to be a clear directional plan that takes into consideration both the timing and speed of such transition, so as to be appropriate for the context and readiness of Thailand’s economy and society.</p><p>A key challenge in steering the Thai economy to prepare for environmental changes is making investments to cope with natural disasters, which requires a significant amount of funds. Meanwhile, market mechanisms do not yet provide adequate incentives for various sectors, particularly SMEs, to make timely transitions, due to a lack of access to environment-related data that can be used to evaluate environment-related opportunities and potential risks, as well as to embed environmental aspects into their decision-making and operational costs. As a result, the degree of transition-readiness varies across different sectors, and actions are implemented at different times, thus impacting their short and long-term competitiveness to varying degrees. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="direction-of-the-bank-of-thailand-bot">Direction of the Bank of Thailand (BOT)<a href="#direction-of-the-bank-of-thailand-bot" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Given the financial sector’s fundamental role in allocating resources to the economy, it also serves as a critical driver in allocating capital to the business sector, especially SMEs, to invest in technologies that will transform their business operations to cope with environmental changes in a timely manner. Therefore, the Bank of Thailand (BOT), as a supervisory authority overseeing the financial sector, particularly financial institutions, hereby sets the direction to support the financial sector’s role in better serving the needs of all sectors in the following ways:</p><ol><li><p>Reducing disparities in each sector’s readiness to transition, by setting up a joint working group comprising the public and private sectors, as well as financial institutions to establish the “Thailand Taxonomy” as a common guideline by which activities can be classified as environmentally-friendly, that can also be used as reference and to ensure common understanding. To begin, activities important to the Thai economy with high rates of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, namely the energy and transportation sectors, will be classified, followed by agricultural and industrial sectors by the end of 2023.</p></li><li><p>Fixing information asymmetry by collaborating with other agencies to develop a national-level platform for environment-related data, in order to ensure sufficient data availability to support the classification of activities according to the Thailand Taxonomy, as well as to support the development of financial products and services. The development of such data platforms is scheduled to start in the fourth quarter of 2022.</p></li><li><p>Expediting the financial sector in incorporating environmental aspects into their operations in a standardized manner. On this, a policy statement on internalizing environmental and climate change aspects in financial institution business will be issued in the third quarter of 2022. Also, financial institutions will be encouraged to devise an “industry handbook”, by the second quarter of 2023, to be used as the minimum standard in risk management, in order to ensure that the financial system can sufficiently allocate capital and offer financial products and services to serve the business sector’s environment-related needs—especially those of SMEs.</p></li><li><p>Creating the right incentives to encourage financial institutions, the business sector, and consumers to recognize the urgency of making environment-related transitions, as well as to alleviate the costs that may incur—both in terms of operational and risk costs. For example, by providing environment-related guarantee mechanisms and financial support for the certification of environmentally-friendly activities. The review process for such incentivizing measures is set to begin in the fourth quarter of 2022.</p></li><li><p>Improving knowledge and skills of the financial sector’s personnel resources by jointly developing courses together with experts from domestic and international agencies. This will raise the level of awareness and understanding, and hence improve their capability in assessing environment-related opportunities and risks as well as in providing advisory support to businesses.</p></li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-success-looks-like">What success looks like<a href="#what-success-looks-like" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>If the financial sector can achieve its intended outcomes, it will support <strong>all sectors</strong> in gaining better understanding, enabling them to classify environmentally-friendly activities based on a common guideline, and have access to environment-related data to be used in their decision-making—such as in policymaking, strategy planning, or risk management. As for the <strong>public sector</strong>, they will be able to conduct policies appropriate for the country-specific context and can better connect to different economic sectors by utilizing the Thailand Taxonomy as a common guideline, with sufficient data availability to back their policy actions. Meanwhile, <strong>financial institutions</strong> will gain credibility, and be able to offer financial products and services that serve the needs of the business sector in their transitioning, at prices that appropriately reflect actual costs and risks. On the other hand, the <strong>business sector</strong> will be able to better compete by transforming their supply chain and operational procedures to be in line with international standards. <strong>SMEs</strong> will become aware of their own gaps in transitioning and have access to funding sources at costs that are not too burdensome, thus enabling them to stay viable in an environmentally-friendly economy. Lastly, <strong>investors and the public</strong> will have access to disclosed and standardized data that can facilitate their decision-making in investments and consumption of financial products and services that promote environmentally-friendly activities.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-info alert alert--info admonition_WoCw"><div class="admonitionHeading_TMsN"><span class="admonitionIcon_Ibzs"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.3 5.69a.942.942 0 0 1-.28-.7c0-.28.09-.52.28-.7.19-.18.42-.28.7-.28.28 0 .52.09.7.28.18.19.28.42.28.7 0 .28-.09.52-.28.7a1 1 0 0 1-.7.3c-.28 0-.52-.11-.7-.3zM8 7.99c-.02-.25-.11-.48-.31-.69-.2-.19-.42-.3-.69-.31H6c-.27.02-.48.13-.69.31-.2.2-.3.44-.31.69h1v3c.02.27.11.5.31.69.2.2.42.31.69.31h1c.27 0 .48-.11.69-.31.2-.19.3-.42.31-.69H8V7.98v.01zM7 2.3c-3.14 0-5.7 2.54-5.7 5.68 0 3.14 2.56 5.7 5.7 5.7s5.7-2.55 5.7-5.7c0-3.15-2.56-5.69-5.7-5.69v.01zM7 .98c3.86 0 7 3.14 7 7s-3.14 7-7 7-7-3.12-7-7 3.14-7 7-7z"></path></svg></span>Engaging all sectors</div><div class="admonitionContent_vXIg"><p>In order to achieve tangible outcomes from steering the economy to address environmental changes, all sectors—public, private, and financial sectors—must take a continuous and integrated approach in their cooperation.
