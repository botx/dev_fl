expansion into digital businesses is aimed at safeguarding depositors and the financial system, as well as ensuring proper consumer protection. Supervision is based on the risk-proportionality principle, under which businesses that are low-risk can be flexibly supervised, whereas high-risk businesses must be subject to stringent supervision. Meanwhile, new businesses that are still risky and do not yet demonstrate clear benefits must be subject to a degree of supervision, in order to put up guardrails to protect the system from adverse impact. Once more clarity is achieved, such supervision can be later adjusted as appropriate. As can be seen, the supervision of banking groups’ engagement in DA business is rather stringent in the early stage, because risks faced by commercial banks and the overall financial system cannot yet be clearly assessed.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="governance">Enhancing corporate governance<a href="#governance" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="preventing-conflict-of-interests">Preventing conflict of interests<a href="#preventing-conflict-of-interests" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Having companies within the banking groups that operate different business would likely expose the group to risks of conflict of interests. These risks would become more significant when companies in the group operate complex businesses<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup>, and when directors concurrently hold positions at both the commercial bank and the parent company that is a holding company, or at a company that operates complex businesses. Such concurrent directorship may influence the decision-making of the commercial bank’s board of directors, as they may not prioritize the interests of the commercial bank’s depositors and stakeholders.</p><p>For example, in the case where a set of directors concurrently holds positions at both the commercial bank and the parent company that is a holding company, if the commercial bank’s directors must decide whether to lend to a company within the holding group to invest in high-risk activities, the directors may weigh the potential returns to the holding company against the investment risks. Conversely, if these boards comprise a different set of members, and the commercial bank’s directors do not have clear stakes in the holding company, they would instead weigh the interest gains from such lending against the risks of a repayment failure, which is a decision-making approach that prioritizes the interests of the commercial bank’s depositors and stakeholders. </p><p>In this regard, because different organizational structures pose different conflicts of interest risks, their supervisory framework reflects those different risk characteristics. Meanwhile, commercial banks’ management should be independent in order to prevent conflicts of interests and have in place checks and balances to enable their board of directors to perform their duties independently. </p><p>The BOT therefore sets the following measures to mitigate the risk of incurring conflict of interests:</p><ul><li><strong>For banking groups whose parent company is <em>not</em> a commercial bank</strong>: directors of the parent company may also assume directorship at the commercial bank, given that they only constitute a minority of the commercial bank’s board of directors. Additionally, the chairman of the board of directors of the parent company and that of the commercial bank must not be the same person, and the audit committee of the parent company must comprise an entirely different set of members from that of the commercial bank’s audit committee.</li><li><strong>For banking groups whose parent company is a commercial bank</strong>: directors of the commercial bank may also assume directorship at any subsidiary company that operates DA-related or VC business, up to a maximum of three-fourths of the board of directors of such subsidiary company. </li></ul><p>Nonetheless, the supervisory measures above still allow for a degree of concurrent directorship. This is to enable a smooth transmission of policies and corporate culture within the group, which would have a positive impact on the banking group’s business operations. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="having-efficient-internal-control-mechanisms">Having efficient internal control mechanisms<a href="#having-efficient-internal-control-mechanisms" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>As the business operations of commercial banks have become more diverse, the parent company must ensure that companies within the banking group operate in accordance with good corporate governance principles, have in place efficient internal controls, together with a segregation of duties between different business units and persons. Also, priority should be given to internal controls and the functioning of the Three Lines of Defense, particularly the second and third lines, whose duties are to control, oversee, and audit business operations independently and thoroughly. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="keeping-pace-with-technological-advancements">Keeping pace with technological advancements<a href="#keeping-pace-with-technological-advancements" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Expanding the scope of business of banking groups, together with changes in technological advancements, may lead to evolving risks that are increasingly diverse. If the banking group’s board of directors lack sufficient knowledge and expertise, it may put the banking group at the risk of having ineffective and incomprehensive oversight, which would then impact the banking group’s business operations and its depositors. The BOT therefore expects and sets a framework on good governance principles, under which commercial banks’ board of directors should be composed of directors with knowledge and expertise appropriate for the banking group’s business operations and risks.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="capital">Strengthening the capital adequacy framework<a href="#capital" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Given that DA is a new business, and its underlying technologies are rapidly evolving, related businesses are therefore exposed to the risks described above, as well as risks that cannot yet be clearly assessed. Moreover, most DAs exhibit high value volatility, so holding DAs would pose the risk of incurring a loss due to a rapid decline in value. </p><p>To ensure that banking groups have adequate capital to prudently provide buffer against new risks, including risks from operating DA business, the BOT has therefore introduced additional supervisory measures. For example, if the commercial bank or a company in the group holds DAs<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup>, the value of such DA holding must be fully deducted from the capital amount, in order to absorb the risk of such asset holding. This is aligned with the initial approach that is being considered by the BCBS and many other countries. </p><p>In addition, banking groups should have adequate capital as buffer against risks in other aspects (Pillar II) as well. Banking groups are required to conduct stress testing using stress scenarios that cover risks from operating DA business and conducting DA-related transactions, and consider maintaining additional capital to absorb other risks, based on the risk profile of the commercial bank and companies within the banking group. This would help ensure that the commercial bank has adequate capital to absorb potential losses and also reinforce the depositors’ confidence. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="contagion">Intragroup contagion risk management<a href="#contagion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>As companies within a banking group are operating businesses that are increasingly diverse and risky, those risks may be transmitted to the commercial bank, who must safekeep the public’s deposits, through interconnected financial and operational linkages within the group (intragroup contagion risk). Furthermore, from the consumers’ perspective, the reputation of companies operating under the same group are often linked, so public confidence in the commercial bank may be undermined by the business operations of other companies within the group. </p><p>To prevent adverse impact from said intragroup contagion between the commercial bank and other companies within the banking group that may be increasingly exposed to new risks, the BOT therefore requires the parent company to: </p><ul><li>Assess risks from the operations of companies within the group that may impact the commercial bank, set measures to manage such impact, and also ensure compliance with the limit on the commercial bank’s investments in and lending to companies within the group;</li><li>Set an annual audit program for companies within the group that operate DA-related businesses;</li><li>Completely segregate DA work system(s) from the commercial bank’s core banking system and maintain strict IT and cyber security to avoid incidents that may disrupt the commercial bank’s operations. </li></ul><p>Moreover, the banking group must not create any misunderstanding that the commercial bank is accountable for the DA-related transactions conducted by DA companies within the group, so as to safeguard the consumers’ confidence in the commercial bank from being undermined by the operations of other companies within the group. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="consumer">Reinforcing consumer protection<a href="#consumer" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Commercial banks have a wide and diverse customer base, which includes vulnerable groups with limited financial literacy and low risk tolerance. Without safeguards, if such groups are provided with sale offers or recommendations on new and highly volatile financial products, such as DAs, through the banks’ business channels or through the usage of the bank’s customer data, they may purchase or invest in DAs without sufficient understanding. In such a case, if losses occur, such losses may exceed the customers’ risk tolerance level. </p><p>To ensure that these customer groups receive fair service and proper protection, the BOT therefore sets an additional supervisory framework<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3" class="footnote-ref">3</a></sup> that takes into account the different risk tolerance level of each customer group.</p><ul><li><strong>For vulnerable customers with limited financial literacy and low risk tolerance</strong>, banking groups must not take any action that would facilitate this customer group in accessing DAs. For example, it is prohibited to solicit, offer the sale of, or provide any other information related to a DA company or DA product, via any channel. It is also prohibited to request the customer’s consent to disclose the customer’s data to a DA business for marketing purposes (marketing consent).</li><li><strong>For customers that are institutional investors or Ultra High Net Worth investors<sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4" class="footnote-ref">4</a></sup> with higher risk tolerance, who have been assessed to understand financial products and the associated risks sufficiently to access DA products</strong>, the banking group may facilitate them in accessing DAs to an appropriate degree. For example, by providing information or advising the client to use services provided by a DA company, recommending a DA asset class, and requesting marketing consent. However, it is still prohibited to solicit or offer the sale of any specific DA. Furthermore, customers should be provided with knowledge and understanding on an ongoing basis, and the usage of customer data must be closely supervised.</li></ul><div class="footnotes"><hr><ol><li id="fn-1">For example, having companies within the group that operate DA-related business or venture capital business.<a href="#fnref-1" class="footnote-backref">↩</a></li><li id="fn-2">A commercial bank can hold DAs only to innovate or enhance the efficiency of their services.
