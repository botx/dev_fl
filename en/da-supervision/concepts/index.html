title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The supervisory approaches considered by the BOT are based on the following facts on digital assets and the current context of the Thai financial sector:</p><ol><li><p>Even though legislation has been passed to allow the operation of DA business, DAs and engagement in DA-related businesses still do pose risks, both to the financial position and credibility of the DA business operator. Moreover, some risks may still remain as “unknown unknowns” which may pose new tail risks to financial system stability. </p></li><li><p>Banking groups are positioned differently from other financial business groups as they accept deposits from the public, are subject to intense supervision, and are familiar to the public; hence, they are trusted by the public.  </p></li><li><p>Although organizational structures may be transitioning to banking groups, banking groups still include the commercial bank, which serves as a financial intermediary between depositors and borrowers, making them critical to other financial institutions and the capital market. </p></li><li><p>Banking groups are businesses that can rapidly expand their market share by leveraging their existing large customer base, as evidenced by how different players in the business sector want commercial banks to become part of their business network or their business partner, in order to achieve leapfrog business growth or use the banks’ large customer database, as well as to be an important source of funds. </p></li><li><p>Many of banking groups’ financial service consumers are vulnerable or have insufficient understanding of investment in new and complex assets such as DAs and the associated risks. Also, most depositors are retail depositors with limited financial assets, as indicated by the fact that <a href="https://www.pier.or.th/abridged/2019/23/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more than half of Thai depositors with deposit accounts at commercial banks have a deposit amount of less than THB 3,200</a>, reflecting their limited financial buffer against investment risks.</p></li><li><p>Many Thais are giving attention to DA investments, as reflected by the <a href="https://markets.chainalysis.com/?range=30&amp;asset=BTC#geography-index" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cryptocurrency Adoption Index</a>, under which Thailand ranked 12<sup>th</sup> highest as the most “open” to DAs<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup>, and also by the number of user accounts at exchanges under the supervision of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which totals to 2.7 million accounts<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup>. This does not include DA investors that are users of exchanges that are registered outside of Thailand.</p></li></ol><ol start="7"><li><p>Over the recent period, the BOT has seen banking groups express their rather high appetite for engagement in DAs. This includes issuing tokens, setting up companies, marketing, and so forth. Their investment appetite in DAs is also quite high compared to leading global banks. Moreover, most applications submitted by businesses were aimed towards marketing purposes or to create a modern brand identity, not to enhance the efficiency of the financial system, which may reflect the current FOMO behavior among market players. </p></li><li><p>Thailand was one of the first countries to pass legislation to accommodate DA business. However, although laws may help regulators in handling and overseeing risks, the scope of supervision may not yet cover emerging DA products or businesses, as they may not be explicitly stated in the relevant laws, hence putting limitations on supervisory oversight. </p></li><li><p>Although DAs on a public blockchain make financial transactions easily traceable, if an account of a wrongdoer is found, it is not possible to freeze such an account because there is no regulator, and most transactions are executed overseas.  </p></li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="risks-observed-by-the-bot">Risks observed by the BOT<a href="#risks-observed-by-the-bot" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Based on the facts above, the BOT, as the authority overseeing economic and financial stability and the supervisor of financial institutions and financial service consumers, sees the following risks that may arise in the absence of supervision of financial business groups in the area of DAs: </p><ul><li><p>Risks from DAs or engagement in DA business may spread to other systems within the banking group, therefore impacting the depositors; or even if financial losses are limited, it may still undermine the depositors’ confidence in the banking group’s future decisions. </p></li><li><p>Risks that arise from banking groups having a wide and diverse customer base, allowing them to rapidly expand their market, and providing them with channels to solicit DA investments from vulnerable groups, or those who lack sufficient understanding of the associated risks. </p></li><li><p>Risks that banking groups may overinvest in DAs or DA businesses, to the extent that it distorts their resource allocation and undermines their function as a financial intermediary between borrowers and depositors, which should be the primary function of commercial banks. Furthermore, the FOMO sentiment may also put pressure on other banking groups to follow suit. </p></li><li><p>Risks that DAs and related businesses may grow quickly while the general public still has insufficient understanding of the risks involved, and without adequate supervision, may lead to systemic risks. Also, in the case where DAs become so widely held by the public that DA transactions are not traceable, DAs may become a tool for money laundering or other financial crimes. </p></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="policy-options-for-the-supervisory-approach">Policy options for the supervisory approach<a href="#policy-options-for-the-supervisory-approach" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>At present, there is not yet an internationally agreed approach in supervising DAs and the undertaking of DA business, as there is still a wide range of issues, and risks are not yet clearly seen. However, international regulators have begun to agree on some risk factors and the need for supervision, although specific approaches may still differ. </p><p>In the case of Thailand, the BOT hopes that the growth of DA business would provide benefits to the public, while also fostering innovation to enhance the efficiency of the financial system. Meanwhile, various risks and the stability of the financial system should also be taken into account. The BOT therefore has explored a range of policy options in supervising banking groups, which can be broadly categorized as follows. </p><ol><li><p><strong>Prohibiting banking groups from undertaking DA-related business</strong></p><ul><li>Pros<ul><li>Is a preventative approach that safeguards depositors and also prevents vulnerable groups or those with limited financial literacy from being solicited to invest in or access DAs through the banks’ business channels. However, other players with a large customer base who are not regulated by the BOT may also engage in DA business. Therefore, DAs would ultimately continue to grow, although at a slower pace.</li></ul></li><li>Cons<ul><li>Banking groups are on an unlevel playing field with non-banks in competing in DA business.</li><li>Creates an environment that does not foster innovation due to limited competition from banking groups. </li><li>Creates unintended consequences e.g. opportunity cost in raising the standard of DA services though banks’ services, or a lack of data from which risks can be monitored, given that DAs would be regarded as business outside the BOT’s supervision under this approach.   </li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Allowing banking groups to engage in DA-related businesses, under an investment limit</strong></p><ul><li>Pros<ul><li>Fosters innovation and allows capable players to engage in DA business. </li><li>As banking groups are regulated, their engagement in the DA market would enable the BOT to monitor risks form data collected from banking groups. </li><li>The BOT can set incentivizing mechanisms for banking groups to raise the standard of DA business, which, in turn, would lead to competition in raising the standard of providing DA service in the country. </li><li>Having investment limits would result in gradual changes, and banking groups must ensure efficient allocation of funds. </li><li>Allows flexibility as the investment limit can later be raised, in line the development of international supervisory standards.</li></ul></li><li>Cons<ul><li>Risks may occur within limited circles if regulators are unable to keep up with the market players’ behavior and business operations. </li><li>Having an investment limit may prevent banking groups from fully competing with non-banks in DA businesses.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>ให้กลุ่ม ธพ. ประกอบธุรกิจเกี่ยวกับ DA ได้อย่างเสรี</strong></p><ul><li>Pros <ul><li>Fosters innovation. </li><li>Provides opportunities for banking groups to freely compete on a level playing field with non-banks in DA business.</li></ul></li><li>Cons<ul><li>Banking groups may hastily invest in DA business due to FOMO, resulting in sub-optimal allocation of funds. </li><li>Rapid expansion of DAs may pose risks to the system while regulators may be late to adapt; or even once risks are identified, there may be challenges in issuing measures to correct past incidents, or large-scale impact on consumers may have already occurred.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ol><p>Since options 2 and 3 may lead to increased risks associated with DA-related businesses, they would need to be accompanied by enhanced supervision in the areas of corporate governance, risk management, and consumer protection.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="bots-chosen-supervisory-approach">BOT&#x27;s chosen supervisory approach<a href="#bots-chosen-supervisory-approach" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The supervisory approach chosen by the BOT to achieve its supervisory objectives must strike a balance between fostering innovation for the benefit of financial service consumers, and proper risk management. This would be accomplished by allowing greater flexibility in banking groups’ scope of business, in order to promote competition and innovation, thus allowing banking groups to adapt in pace with technological advancements while considering both benefits and risks. At the same time, increased flexibility must be accompanied by enhanced supervisory oversight.  Otherwise, incautious expansion in the scope of business and growth of new businesses may pose risks that cannot yet be comprehensively assessed, which may adversely impact consumers, banking groups, or escalate to a large-scale impact on the financial sector and economic system. <strong>The BOT therefore has chosen the second supervisory approach, which is to allow banking groups to engage in DA business under an investment limit.</strong> </p><p>Although, in the short term, this enhanced supervision may raise the business costs of banking groups and place them at a competitive disadvantage compared to other players who are not supervised by the BOT, its implementation is necessary. This approach would allow for the handling of new risks while ensuring that banking groups remain strong, public confidence in the banking sector is maintained, and consumers are protected. Other countries have also implemented similar measures<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3" class="footnote-ref">3</a></sup> to oversee their retail consumers’ access to DAs. Additionally, this enhanced supervision would help ensure that banking groups pursue business growth in a prudent and sustainable manner and encourage DA businesses to have good service standards and provide proper consumer protection, thereby setting a good example for other players.
