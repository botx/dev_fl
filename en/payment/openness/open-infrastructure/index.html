Open Infrastructure</h1></header><blockquote><p><em>Open Infrastructure: Develop shared and interoperable payment infrastructures under a good governance structure and a reasonable pricing structure</em></p></blockquote><p><strong>Origin of the development</strong>: Payment services are not responsive to the business sector&#x27;s needs. Unfair access to infrastructures exists. Governance mechanisms are deficient and ineffective.</p><ul><li>Payment infrastructure is essential for developing services that meet the needs of users across all sectors. Thai retail payments have previously been highly successful owing to the critical infrastructure, namely the PromptPay system. Digital payments for the business sector, however, still require the proper infrastructure to satisfy the need for end-to-end integration of trade transactions and payments.</li><li>Bank and non-bank payment service providers continue to face cost and arrangement disparities when accessing existing infrastructures. This stifles competition and hinders overall payment system efficiency improvement.</li><li>Currently, no clear governance structure is in place in the payment systems to support the efficient management of infrastructure services and the transmission of the BOT&#x27;s payment policies, as well as to ensure the involvement of relevant parties, to establish clear agreements and standards, and to manage the infrastructure landscape for maximum utilization.</li></ul><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-principle alert alert--principle admonition_WoCw"><div class="admonitionHeading_TMsN"><span class="admonitionIcon_Ibzs"><svg viewBox="0 0 496 512" width="16" height="16"><path fill="currentColor" d="M347.94 129.86L203.6 195.83a31.938 31.938 0 0 0-15.77 15.77l-65.97 144.34c-7.61 16.65 9.54 33.81 26.2 26.2l144.34-65.97a31.938 31.938 0 0 0 15.77-15.77l65.97-144.34c7.61-16.66-9.54-33.81-26.2-26.2zm-77.36 148.72c-12.47 12.47-32.69 12.47-45.16 0-12.47-12.47-12.47-32.69 0-45.16 12.47-12.47 32.69-12.47 45.16 0 12.47 12.47 12.47 32.69 0 45.16zM248 8C111.03 8 0 119.03 0 256s111.03 248 248 248 248-111.03 248-248S384.97 8 248 8zm0 448c-110.28 0-200-89.72-200-200S137.72 56 248 56s200 89.72 200 200-89.72 200-200 200z"></path></svg></span>Principles</div><div class="admonitionContent_vXIg"><ul><li><strong><span class="principle-yes">What we wish to see</span></strong>
Payment infrastructures are up-to-standards, stable, secure, interoperable, accessible to various service providers at an affordable price, and driven by an effective payment system governance structure. Such infrastructures foster competition in the development of innovation and financial services to better serve the public and business needs, facilitating and accelerating Thailand&#x27;s transition into the digital economy and a less-cash society.</li><li><strong><span class="principle-no">What we do not wish to see</span></strong>
Payment infrastructures are fragmented or redundant to the point of inefficiency or are so concentrated that they pose a concentration risk. The pricing structures do not reflect actual costs, while shared usage is limited. As a result, such infrastructures will discourage competition in innovation and payment services development. In addition, there is no governance mechanism to support the effective and appropriate implementation of the BOT&#x27;s policies.</li></ul></div></div><p><strong>Payment infrastructure development is divided into two parts</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Hard infrastructure</strong> refers to the development of infrastructure for the business sector, in addition to well-developed retail payment systems such as the PromptPay and Thai QR Code.</li><li><strong>Soft infrastructure</strong> focuses on developing and implementing central standards to promote interoperability, lower costs, and increase efficiencies of connection and business operations of various service providers, leading to the development of seamless services. Soft infrastructure development also includes enhancing payment systems governance by arranging for collaboration, coordination, and development expansion, which will reinforce the strengths of the Thai payment systems.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="open-infra-plan">Open Infrastructure Key Initiatives 2022–2024<a href="#open-infra-plan" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="promtbiz">1.1 Develop digital financial and payment infrastructure for businesses (the PromptBiz system)<a href="#promtbiz" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="concept-and-principles-of-the-promptbiz-system">Concept and Principles of the &quot;PromptBiz System&quot;<a href="#concept-and-principles-of-the-promptbiz-system" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p><strong>The PromptBiz system is a unified infrastructure for trade and payment data in digital business processes leveraging the ISO 20022 international message standard.</strong> The system eliminates the current problem of excessive paperwork, which leads to high costs, time-consuming follow-up and document review, and possible errors.

Trade transactions such as invoice presentment and e-Tax invoice issuance will be linked to payments, which will contain trade information and connect to the e-Receipt service. The first phase is the development of core services, namely (1) e-Invoice delivery service that connects to the Tax Service Providers (TSP) and (2) e-Receipt/e-Tax Invoice data exchange service with payment functionality via the Bulk Payment system. The system is expected to be completed in April 2023. The next phase will extend the linkage to the D-Business platform<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup> to expand services to individual entrepreneurs and to support real-time or near real-time and high-value transactions. Further, a study will be conducted to explore the feasibility of developing a Digital Cheque (D-Cheque) as an alternative to meet the needs of businesses requiring cheque usage.</li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Part 2: Digital Supply Chain Finance</strong>
Efforts will focus on developing a mechanism to support business lending, particularly for SMEs, by utilizing trade and payment data from Part 1. The first phase is the development of invoice verification and double financing examination services, which began operation on December 15, 2021. In the early stage, the system still requires data submission. Once Part 1 is completed, data will be transmitted through the PromptBiz system, after which other service extensions will be developed.</p><p>  <img loading="lazy" alt="Business sector problems" src="/dev_fl/en/assets/images/supply-chain-d3fab10563772aa531fd1260e8ac5978.png" width="3904" height="866" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>  In the initial phase, large corporates and SMEs (juristic persons only) who currently use  Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems or software that can digitally process trade documents and payments can apply for the PromptBiz services through participating pilot banks. The next phase will expand the PromptBiz services scope, service providers, and users to facilitate individual entrepreneurs. Large corporates and SMEs applying for the PromptBiz services through participating banks can use their corporate ERP systems by upgrading their document or data delivery systems according to the PromptBiz connection standards, based on ETDA Recommendation on ICT Standard for Electronic Transactions: Trade Services Message Standard (3-2017).</p></li></ul><p>Remark: In the future, the BOT will consider exploring the connection between the Domestic Business Platform in the PromptBiz system and the National Digital Trade Platform (NDTP).</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="enhance_standard">1.2 Elevate the adoption of international and central standards in payment systems<a href="#enhance_standard" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="concept-and-principles">Concept and Principles<a href="#concept-and-principles" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>The BOT encourages the adoption of international and central standards in payment systems.

In addition, the system will be able to handle additional payment-related information, for instance, the sender and receiver details (such as English name, Thai name, personal/juristic person identification number, address, account number, and account type), the purpose of funds transfer, business data and tax data.) The improvement will enable more accurate transaction reconciliation and verification, promote interoperability with other critical infrastructures, and create opportunities for innovation.

By using the API technology with the ISO 20022 message standards, the infrastructure supports interoperability with other important domestic infrastructures and the extension of financial innovations, for example, funds transfer services, securities settlement services, high-value payments via PromptBiz, and near real-time third-party funds transfer services. The BAHTNET API HUB will be the primary channel for domestic large-value funds transfer and is anticipated to be available by the end of 2023.</p></li></ol><ol start="3"><li><strong>The ISO 20022 Migration (Retail Payment Systems) project</strong> involves perfecting the existing payment infrastructures, namely, the Bulk Payment system and the PromptPay system, to better accommodate the public and business needs. Both are anticipated to be completed by 2023. In addition, the QR Payment system (merchant-presented mode) is upgraded to increase efficiency in the paying/receiving funds with a planned launch date in 2024. The next phase will aim to improve the Cross-bank Bill Payment system for the business sector and enhance the Bill Alert system to build on the PromptPay services for businesses and increase the efficiency of the PromptPay&#x27;s funds transfer services for individuals.</li></ol><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="governance">1.3 Establish a payment system governance structure and a reasonable pricing structure<a href="#governance" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="concept-and-principles-1">Concept and Principles<a href="#concept-and-principles-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Previously, Thai digital payments have grown exponentially with diverse linkages. The payment governance structure, however, has not been updated in time to reflect the changing context. Consequently, policy transmission is hampered due to insufficient stakeholder involvement. Rules and regulations become impediments to promoting a level playing field. Meanwhile, the landscape of payment infrastructure services reveals redundancy and concentration, leading to underutilization.

The PSF will allow all relevant sectors to participate in the effective implementation of the BOT policies introduced by the Payment Systems Committee (PSC). The group will also provide recommendations on the direction of payment development and the development of payment services and innovations that will benefit end-users. The PSF will deliberate on the following issues:</p><ul><li>Directions for payment systems and service developments and effective policy implementation</li><li>Essential standard guidelines for domestic and cross-border services</li><li>The adoption of international standards in the Thai payment systems</li><li>Communication and user education strategies to promote digital payments</li></ul><p>  <strong>The composition of the PFS</strong> will be drawn from interested parties, including representatives from payment business providers, users, and governments who have knowledge and experience in the payment systems in the fields of payment business, technology, and law. In addition, experts or representatives from specific agencies may be present to support the relevant agendas. The PSF will have a joint secretariat of representatives from the BOT and payment system service providers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Establish a Central Payment Services Office (CPSO)</strong>
The CPSO will serve as a working group for managing major payment services following international practices. The office will be responsible for setting guidelines and standards, including business, legal, technical, and operational rules, gathering information, and improving payment system services. The CPSO will also function as a coordinator and representative in domestic and international collaboration. Initially, the main services under the CPSO’s purview will be those widely adopted and providing linkages domestically and internationally, namely, the PromptPay, the Thai QR Payment, and the PromptBiz services.</p><p>  <strong>CPSO Roles and Responsibilities</strong></p><ul><li>Issue business rules, terms of service, pricing structure, and technical standards</li><li>Set access criteria and requirements for service applications</li><li>Push forward continuous improvements of related products and services</li><li>Review and track compliance with the above rules and requirements</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Review the management of payment system infrastructures and the payment services pricing structure to enhance efficiency</strong> and elevate important payment infrastructures to the domestic infrastructures.

In collaboration with financial institutions, the BOT initiated &quot;Project Inthanon&quot; in 2017 to explore the feasibility and efficiency of CBDC in the financial institution sector. The project has progressed successively and has recently been extended for cross-border funds transfers under the Inthanon-LionRock project, a joint project with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. The partnership has further expanded to the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates and the Digital Currency Institute of the People&#x27;s Bank of China, resulting in a new project known as the Multiple Central Bank Digital Currency Bridge Project (mBridge). The mBridge project aims to develop a prototype for multi-currency cross-border funds transfers while emphasizing enhancing the efficiency of liquidity management, maintaining the privacy of financial transactions, and testing the capability of the DLT system to handle large transaction volumes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Retail CBDC for the Public and Business sectors</strong>
Retail CBDC is a development effort to explore a CBDC model that facilitates innovation development through programming conditions on the CBDC (programmability) with security, credibility, and suitability for usage in the public and business sectors.
