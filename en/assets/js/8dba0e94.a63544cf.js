to enable them to assess and manage risks and also evaluate business opportunities.","sidebar":"green-en"},"directions/data-and-disclosure":{"id":"directions/data-and-disclosure","title":"Data and Disclosure: systematic and accessible data platforms, and financial institutions\u2019 data disclosure standards","description":"Information asymmetry is one of the main obstacles to actions on environmental sustainability. Because of this, numerous sectors lack sufficient information for their decision-making and in supporting their work operations. The BOT therefore plans to develop a national-level environment-related data ecosystem that is accessible to all sectors to be utilized to their full potential. This would help improve the quality of environment-related data in accordance with good data governance principles, in terms of (1) data availability (2) data comparability and (3) data reliability. As a result, data obtained from different agencies would be transparent, verifiable, ready-to-use for in-depth analytics, and also have a common standard that would facilitate better data connectivity and comparability.","sidebar":"green-en"},"directions/incentive-structure":{"id":"directions/incentive-structure","title":"Incentive: to support and incentivize environmental actions in the financial sector","description":"Given the impact from environmental policies, pressure from the international community, and the continuous announcements of net zero emission targets by large corporates, Thai businesses\u2014particularly SMEs that are in the supply chain of the manufacturing, service, and export sectors\u2014must expedite their transition and raise the standard of their environmental actions, so as to avoid falling behind the curve or being barred from participating in the supply chain. As SMEs face high cost barriers in their transitioning, they require financial support that adequately meets their needs. Meanwhile, financial institutions are still unable to properly evaluate environmental risks and impact. As a result, their price-setting behaviors do not reflect risks or clearly differentiate environmentally-friendly activities from environmentally-unfriendly activities. It is therefore necessary to create incentives to encourage the business sector to transition, and so that financial institutions can sufficiently allocate capital and offer financial products and services to accommodate such transition.","sidebar":"green-en"},"directions/overview":{"id":"directions/overview","title":"The BOT\u2019s approach in tackling environmental changes","description":"\x3c!--","sidebar":"green-en"},"directions/products-and-services":{"id":"directions/products-and-services","title":"Products and services: Adjusting financial institutions\u2019 operations to promote green financial products and services that serve the needs of businesses","description":"Presently, environmental impact is not yet incorporated into the costs of financial institutions\u2019 operations. Since these operations vary across different financial institutions and are not standardized, it is therefore necessary to raise the standard of financial institutions\u2019 operations to support environmental sustainability\u2014by taking into consideration the principles and implications of opportunities and risks and integrating them into their end-to-end business process, which includes setting up a governance structure, strategic planning, risk management processes, and disclosing data to the public. Ultimately, this would encourage the financial sector to adequately offer a diverse range of financial products and services that can serve the needs of the economy as it transitions towards becoming an environmentally-friendly economy. That said, in raising such standards, finding a balance between international standards and the readiness of financial institutions and the Thai economy must be a key consideration.","sidebar":"green-en"},"directions/taxonomy":{"id":"directions/taxonomy","title":"Taxonomy: classification of economic activities based on their environmental impact","description":"Given that different sectors do not yet share a common understanding of environmentally-friendly activities, efforts to mobilize environmental actions, particularly capital allocation, are not yet on-target. Consequently, this may lead to greenwashing and inadequate allocation of capital for businesses in their transitional activities. For this reason, there needs to be a standard (taxonomy) by which economic activities are defined and classified based on their environmental impact. This would ensure a common understanding among the public, business, and financial sectors, and also serve as reference in the process of policymaking, strategic planning, and development of businesses\u2019 products and services in a standardized and consistent manner. In turn, this would help each sector in evaluating its environment-related performance and formulating plans to adapt during the transitional phase, to be suitable and well-timed under Thailand\u2019s context.","sidebar":"green-en"},"executive-summary":{"id":"executive-summary","title":"Transitioning Towards Environmental Sustainability Under the New Thai Financial Landscape","description":"Executive summary","sidebar":"green-en"},"financial-sector":{"id":"financial-sector","title":"Role of the financial sector in responding to environmental changes","description":"The financial sector has an important role in allocating funds to the economic system, and therefore is critical in supporting businesses and households to adapt during the transition period. In doing so, this should not increase debt servicing risks to financial institutions to the extent that would jeopardize financial stability in the long term, and should create new environmentally-friendly investment opportunities to facilitate economic restructuring. In contrast, if the financial sector does not help promote and support the business sector in responding to climate change in a sustainable manner, the financial sector itself will lose business and investment opportunities that would allow it to properly diversify its own risks.","sidebar":"green-en"},"involvement":{"id":"involvement","title":"Engaging all sectors to mobilize actions in response to environmental problems","description":"The BOT recognizes that steering the economy towards an environmentally sustainable growth path can only be achieved through a collaborative effort from all sectors, part of which is driven by the financial sector. The success of such endeavor would, however, also require laying down the country\u2019s groundwork in the following aspects:","sidebar":"green-en"},"overview":{"id":"overview","title":"Introduction","description":"By issuing this Directional Paper on transitioning towards environmental sustainability under the new Thai financial landscape, the BOT aims to set out the strategic direction for every sector\u2014in particular, the financial sector\u2014in order to accelerate their transition and to develop the necessary infrastructure to adapt to environmental changes, especially climate change. This is part of the overarching effort in repositioning the Thai Financial Landscape, which aims to strike a balance between promoting innovation and managing risks in order to support the transition towards a digital and environmentally-friendly economy.","sidebar":"green-en"},"results":{"id":"results","title":"What success looks like","description":"The BOT expects that by following the approaches outlined above, the financial sector will be able to support the smooth and timely transition towards an environmentally-friendly economy, so that every sector can cope with risks arising from environmental and climate change in a timely manner.","sidebar":"green-en"}}}')}}]);
