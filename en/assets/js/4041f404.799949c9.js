This supervisory framework focuses on overseeing banking groups that operate complex and potentially high-risk businesses. For example, groups with companies that operate DA-related or venture capital businesses. The framework is also applicable to all types of banking group structures, including those with a holding company as the parent company, and those with a commercial bank as the parent company, based on the principle of risk proportionality.","sidebar":"da-supervision"},"directions/supervision":{"id":"directions/supervision","title":"Enhanced regulatory framework for banking groups","description":"Enhancing the regulatory framework of banking groups to accommodate organizational restructurings and their expansion into digital businesses is aimed at safeguarding depositors and the financial system, as well as ensuring proper consumer protection. Supervision is based on the risk-proportionality principle, under which businesses that are low-risk can be flexibly supervised, whereas high-risk businesses must be subject to stringent supervision. Meanwhile, new businesses that are still risky and do not yet demonstrate clear benefits must be subject to a degree of supervision, in order to put up guardrails to protect the system from adverse impact. Once more clarity is achieved, such supervision can be later adjusted as appropriate. As can be seen, the supervision of banking groups\u2019 engagement in DA business is rather stringent in the early stage, because risks faced by commercial banks and the overall financial system cannot yet be clearly assessed.","sidebar":"da-supervision"},"objectives":{"id":"objectives","title":"Supervisory objectives","description":"* Supporting technology or financial services that would improve the efficiency of the financial system, further develop financial services, and provide greater access to financial services to benefit the public and the business sector, while allowing the utilization of DAs for beneficial purposes.","sidebar":"da-supervision"},"overview":{"id":"overview","title":"Banking group\u2019s digital asset business: Supervisory approach and management of risks to the financial system","description":"In the past 2\u20133 decades, advancements in information technology and telecommunications have been a significant global transition that led to open and borderless linkages, the development of faster processing systems, as well as reduced costs in data collection and processing.
