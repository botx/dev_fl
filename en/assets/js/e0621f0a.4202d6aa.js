The service accommodates payment needs in the public, business, and government sectors, such as individual funds transfers, government welfare payments, cross-bank bill payments, and payment reminders (PayAlert). PromptPay has reached 69 million registered numbers, with an average of over 36 million transactions per day and a daily average value of more than 100 billion baht. In addition, the PromptPay service has been extended to support standard QR codes for payments, which are widely available in retail stores, stalls, shopping malls, and public transport services. Currently, there are over 7 million QR payment acceptance points.
