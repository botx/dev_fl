The aims are to adjust to a rapidly changing environment and facilitate the transition to a sustainable digital economy.","sidebar":"virtual-bank-en"},"licensing":{"id":"licensing","title":"3.

Expected results","description":"The BOT expects virtual banks to sustainably achieve Green Lines, namely, (1) offering full-service banking businesses that serve the need of each customer segment, especially the underserved and unserved, (2) offering better experiences of financial services for customers, and (3) stimulating healthy competition in the Thai financial institution system. On the other hand, virtual banks should not be creating risks to the financial system, depositors, or consumers as a whole. The BOT and the Ministry of Finance will monitor and evaluate the performance of virtual banks continually and closely. If the future context suggests that there should be more virtual banks in the financial institution system to achieve Green Lines, the BOT and the Ministry of Finance may consider opening for more virtual bank licenses in the future.","sidebar":"virtual-bank-en"}}}')}}]);
